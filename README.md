# Food Desert Statistical Analyses

This repository contains two related projects that analyzed food desert data to answer research questions.

### 01: Food Deserts and Diabetes Prevalence
Methodology: Linear Regression

Key question: **Do food deserts have an adverse effect on health, as explored by the relationship with diabetes prevalence?**

Key finding: Low physical food access itself does not have a positive causal effect on diabetes prevalence.

Findings from this analysis suggested a necessary deeper dive into the definition of a food desert - leading to project 02.

### 02: Food Desert Definition Analysis
Methodology: Exploratory Factor Analysis, Logistic Regression

Key question:
There is no one way to define a food desert based on empirical measures. Various combinations of thresholds of distance to supermarkets, income level, and vehicle access are available as potential food desert indicators. **What types of areas typically qualify as food deserts using these indicators. Are the trends consistent for all food desert indicators?**

Key Finding: The different methods of defining a food desert are capturing different types of areas.
